# Weather App

## Goals

- make a weather dashboard that displays the current temperature and conditions (raining, sunny, etc) for 5 major cities. All 5 should be visible at once.
- user can enter a city name to add that city to the dashboard
- user should be able to remove any city from the dashboard
- user can leave the site and come back to it later and it should remember what cities are displayed on their dashboard
- user should be able to select a city that is currently displayed on the dashboard and see a 5 day forecast, with one or two charts displaying temperatures for the next 5 days.
